                <p>
                    In 2021, under the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed two robots designed for elementary school students to assemble at home. 
                    These robots were created for the regional community outreach project "<a href="https://www.tokuyama.ac.jp/robocon/2021_new/index.html" target="_blank">Shunan Robocon</a>" organized by Tokuyama College. The <a href="https://www.tokuyama.ac.jp/robocon/2021/" target="_blank">workshop</a> was conducted online, with wooden parts laser-cut into kits for easy assembly at home. 
                    This project was carried out by a team, with my primary responsibility being the design of the robots.

                <h2>Serving Robot</h2>
                <p>
                    The arm opens and closes to grab a ball, carry it to a plate, and place it at a designated position.
                </p>
                <h2>Dish Delivery Robot</h2>
                <p>
                    Functions like a forklift, raising and lowering the platform to carry plates and place them in specific locations to multiply points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These robots operate in white and black areas, performing their respective roles based on competition rules.

                <h1>Specs and Results</h1>
                <h2>Design Innovations</h2>
                <p>Adopted a design with interlocking parts, allowing anyone to assemble accurately by following the instructions, avoiding dimensional errors and quality inconsistencies.</p>
                <h2>Roles in Competition</h2>
                <p>The serving robot accurately places balls, and the dish delivery robot transports them, working together to score points.</p>
                <h2>Online Adaptation</h2>
                <p>Kits of pre-processed wooden parts were created to suit the online workshop format. This allowed many elementary school students to experience the joy of robot building at home.</p>
                <p>This project successfully provided elementary school students with a robot-making experience and realized the contest despite constraints.</p>
