                    <h1>About</h1>
                    <p>
                        While developing a quadruped robot to improve technical skills, the need for a high-torque and compact actuator became apparent.
                        To address this challenge, I developed the "Internal Cycloidal Drive," which integrates an outrunner BLDC motor, a cycloidal reducer, and a driver into one unit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In particular, the joints of a quadruped robot experience significant impact when landing, making the high rigidity and durability of the cycloidal mechanism an optimal choice.
                        This design achieves an efficient and reliable actuator.

                    <h1>How it works</h1>
                    <h2>Features of Cycloidal Gears</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cycloidal gears offer high torque and excellent impact resistance, but they also present challenges such as vibrations at high speeds and complex shape processing.
                        To address these issues, I adopted a structure that combines two cycloidal discs in reverse phase, reducing vibrations caused by eccentric motion.
                        Additionally, advanced 3D printing technology was utilized to ensure high-precision parts.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Assembly and Improvements</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assemble the cycloidal mechanism by mounting the rotor with N52 neodymium magnets and the stator with wound coils into the housing.</li>
                        <li>11 outer ring pins were arranged to achieve a reduction ratio of 10:1.</li>
                        <li>Clearance adjustment of shafts and bearings was critical. In the prototype stage, contact issues between the rotor and stator arose but were resolved through redesign and precise adjustments.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Specifications</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduction Ratio: 10:1</li>
                        <li>Rotor Poles: 42 / Stator Slots: 36</li>
                        <li>Coil Wire Gauge: 22 AWG (Star Connection)</li>
                        <li>Designed for medium-speed and high-torque operation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Test Results</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tests with a low-cost ESC revealed that while self-starting was difficult due to slight contact between the rotor and stator, manual assistance enabled proper operation.</li>
                        <li>The performance of rotational speed reduction and torque amplification was demonstrated as expected.</li>
                        <li>Noise remains a challenge but is expected to improve with future redesigns.</li>
                        <li>The next step is to introduce a custom FOC-capable ESC to achieve more precise position, speed, and torque control.</li>
