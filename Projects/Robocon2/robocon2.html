            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                In the second year of the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering program at Tokuyama College, a robot contest featuring manually operated robots is held. 
                The competition for the year I participated involved robots climbing to the top of a stage using stairs or a ramp and competing for the fastest time to return to the starting point. 
                With the goal of tackling the shortest route via stairs, I designed and built a dedicated robot. 
                This experience became a valuable challenge that fueled my motivation and growth for the third-year contest.

            <h1>How it works</h1>
            <p>
                The robot designed to climb stairs featured the following characteristics and actions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Structure:</strong> Composed of three tracks, with the front track being liftable. The rear of the robot included a column capable of moving up and down.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Steps for Climbing Stairs:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Lift the front track to push onto the stairs, placing the front part of the robot on the upper step.</li>
                        <li>Lower the rear column to push the rear part of the robot up, then advance to the upper step.</li>
                        <li>Raise the column back up for storage and proceed to the next step.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This mechanism aimed to enable quick stair climbing.

            <h1>Specs and Results</h1>
            <h2>Design Features</h2>
            <p>
                Specialized design for stair climbing, featuring a liftable track and a column for pushing the robot upward. These elements enabled efficient operation even with manual control.
            </p>
            <h2>Competition Results</h2>
            <p>
                By choosing the stair route, I entered the competition but was eliminated in the third round. This frustration became the starting point for my growth in the following yearâ€™s contest.
            </p>
            <h2>Lessons Learned and Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                Through trial and error in designing and operating the robot to overcome the challenges of stair climbing, I honed my creativity and practical skills in robot development. 
                For the next attempt, I strongly recognized the importance of more efficient design and execution.
