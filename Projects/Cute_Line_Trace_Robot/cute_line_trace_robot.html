                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>
                    From August to October 2023, I developed an educational line trace robot designed to teach both programming and electronics. 
                    This educational tool aims to provide an experience where learners can feel like the robot is their learning partner, combining adorable design with practicality. 
                    The robot features a board on its back for creating electronic circuits, allowing learners to gain knowledge of electronics in addition to programming. This project was carried out by a team of three members, with the technical aspects such as robot design being primarily my responsibility.

                <h1>How it works</h1>
                <h2>Miniaturization and Design Innovations</h2>
                <p>
                    The robot is compact, with a height of about 13 cm. To efficiently use internal space, gears were used to offset the wheel rotation axes. 
                    To counter the bulky appearance caused by the battery placement, a design with a protruding structure at the back was adopted, balancing the overall look.
                </p>
                <h2>Electronics and Programming</h2>
                <p>
                    The robot is equipped with an electronics board at the back, enabling users to engage in both programming and electronic assembly. 
                    This makes it a versatile educational tool for learning both hardware and software concepts.

                <h2>Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Educational tool combining programming and electronics learning.</li>
                    <li>Compact and well-designed robot suitable for learning purposes.</li>
                    <li>Equipped with an electronics board for hands-on electronic assembly.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Use Cases</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><a href="https://co-nextion.github.io/" target="_blank">Tokuyama College Festival "Line Trace Project"</a></strong>: Conducted two-day programming lessons during Tokuyama College's open campus. 15 children assembled the robots and successfully completed line tracing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Programming Classes at After-School Programs in Nara Prefecture</strong>: Held six programming classes using this educational tool. The children learned programming concepts and eventually achieved line tracing with their own programs.</li>
                </ul>
